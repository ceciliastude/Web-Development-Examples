I came to the head of my people, who were exhausted by frequent wars, I the Geth Burebista raised the state so much by exercises, abstinence from wine and obedience to the commandments, that in a few years he made a powerful state and subjected the Geths to the most most of the neighboring populations, coming to be feared even by the Romans.
