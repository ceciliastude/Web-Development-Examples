><Background
>Born in 85 BC, Asterix is a tiny but fearless and cunning warrior, ever eager for new adventures. He lives in the year 50 BC in a Gaulish village located in northwest Armorica. Asterix is one of the smartest and most sensible members of the village, and so he is usually chosen for any dangerous, important, or exotic mission. Unlike most of the other villagers, he does not start or join brawls for the fun of it, although he does enjoy a good fight when there's cause. He rarely resorts to weapons, preferring to rely on his wits, and when necessary, his (magic potion enhanced) fists â€” though he carries his sword with him wherever he goes, he is shown to be only an average swordsman. What he does for a living is never truly known, though he is often shown running errands or out shopping and hunting. In Asterix and the Cauldron, however, it is clearly stated that neither he nor Obelix has ever done anything of the sort to 'earn' money.</Background
