        <b>Moving technology supply chain to the fast lane</b>
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        A gadget’s quality or innovation may not matter if it can’t reach the 
        market quickly or before the competition due to shipping delays. 
        Speed through the supply chain can lead to unprecedented gains 
        for technology companies, not only for their products, but also top-
        line growth. Nearly 8 in 10 companies with high-performing supply 
        chains achieve revenue growth higher than the average within their 
        industries.

        <br />
        Over the last 2 years, the perception of supply chains 
        has changed. Logistics has gone from backroom talks to 
        being a constant topic in board meetings. A fast supply
        chain has become a competitive advantage for technology 
        companies, helping boost market share and customer 
        loyalty.
