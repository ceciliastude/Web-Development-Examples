    "Background\n": "Peter Quill was born on Earth, the son of a human mother and an alien father. Plucked from his rural home, he was thrust into a life of roguery and adventure across the stars. Now teamed up with a group called the Guardians of the Galaxy, Peter Quill has been kicking bad guy butts and saving the day under a different moniker: Star-Lord.",
    "Strengths\n": "As Star-Lord, Peter Quill wears a suit that grants augmented strength and durability and the ability to travel through space. He uses an \"Element Gun\", a special meta-pistol capable of projecting one of the four elements (air, earth, fire and water).",
    "Weaknesses\n": "The scene points out one of Quill's greatest weaknesses: He's emotional and a showoff. Quill's emotions and bravado constantly get the better of him in the MCU. In Guardians of the Galaxy, Quill's goofing off delays his trip to get the Power Stone, giving Korath (Djimon Hounsou) and his troops time to surround him."
