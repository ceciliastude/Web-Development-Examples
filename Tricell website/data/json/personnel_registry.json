Once Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj, where he was trained by the Ancient One in the ways of Magic and the Multiverse. Although he focused on healing his hands, Strange was drawn into a conflict with Kaecilius and the Zealots, who were working for Dormammu and had sought to merge Earth with the Dark Dimension to find an eternal life. Following the demise of the Ancient One and the defeat of Kaecilius, Strange then became the new protector for the Sanctum Sanctorum, seeking to defend the Earth from other inter-dimensional threats."
