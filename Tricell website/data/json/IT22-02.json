He almost did not survive his \nfirst few months of life due to health conditions and parental neglect, and was once nearly sold to \nCarmine Falcone's criminal organization to settle his parentâ€™s debts. After his parents were killed \nby Sal Maroni for failed attempt to steal from one of the crime lord's warehouses, eight-year-old \nJason was forced to live on the streets of Gotham.\n\nBatman caught him when he had already stolen one of the tires and was coming to take the others. \nBatman tried to put Jason in a boarding school for troubled kids, but this did not work out for \nJason as the owner of the school was actually running a training ground for youthful criminals. \nBatman instead decides that perhaps the boy's anger could be channeled against criminals as or else \nthe boy would likely end up a criminal himself. This is how Jason Todd became the\nsecond Robin.",
