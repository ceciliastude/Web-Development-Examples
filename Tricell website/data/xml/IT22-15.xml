><Background
>Scott Lang is an ex-convict and electronics expert hired by Stark International, which enables him to steal the Ant-Man suit from Hank Pym, who had long since given up the name, to help his sick daughter. When Pym finds out, he gives the suit to Lang, allowing him to become the second Ant-Man. As Ant-Man, he serves as an Avenger for years,</Background
><Strengths
>Ant-Man is capable of reducing to a subatomic level by using Pym Particles to shift his mass into another dimension without reducing density, allowing him to keep his original human strength while still being as small as an ant.</Strengths
><Weaknesses
>Weaknesses. Limited Mobility: Although Ant-Man possesses superhuman strength and durability, but when he is in his giant-size form, this also limits his mobility, making him slow and slightly clumsy.</Weaknesses
